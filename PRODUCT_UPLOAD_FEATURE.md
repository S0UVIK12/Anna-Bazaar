### AI Integration (Simulated)
Currently using simulated AI responses. To integrate real Gemini API:

1. Get Gemini API key
2. Update `handleAIAutoFill` function in `ProductUploadForm.js`
3. Replace simulation with actual API call:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('YOUR_GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    prompt: `Suggest product details for: ${formData.product}`,
    image: formData.image 
  })
});
```

### Data Structure
